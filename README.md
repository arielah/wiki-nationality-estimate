first_full_pass.tsv: a simple file with 340K scraped name and nationalities. Some of the entries are garbage but surprisingly few are. 
leverage_first_sentence.py: contains the logic that produced first_full_pass.tsv.
all_urls: Wikipedia will only serve up 200 names per page on Category:Living_people. To get around this, I made a list of every indexed URL needed to get all the pages in the category.
